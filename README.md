# Omnipresent computing

This is the code repository for the manuscript: [Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818) by T.G. de Jong, H. Notsu and K. Nakajima. 

**About the code:** The code is subdivided following the structure of the manuscript. Experiments for the main document can be found in the folder main and experiments for the supplementary information can be found in supp. The notable exceptions to this structure are the music producing oscillator networks and the additional time-series tests which can both be found in the supp folder.

**About the data:** The time-series already have been generated, but generate_data.py can be used to generate them again. Because most of the underlying time-series correspond to chaotic systems the results might vary a bit depending on the module versions you use. 

**About code updates:** As code refinements and follow-up projects are on their way the current version should really be viewed as running in beta.
